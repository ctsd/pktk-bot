      <p>
        Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all sensitive information you supply through our blog, website or app is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. <br>

      <br>
      <p class="strong">Do we use ‘cookies’?</p>
      <p>
        Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site’s or service provider’s systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.<br>
        <br>
        We use cookies to:
        <ul>
          <li>Understand and save user’s preferences for future visits.</li>
          <li>Compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions in order to offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may also use trusted third-party services that track this information on our behalf.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="strong">Third-party disclosure</p>
      <p>
        We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information unless we provide users with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release information when it’s release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others’ rights, property or safety.<br>
        <br>
        However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="strong">Third-party links</p>
      <p>
        Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party products or services on our blog, website or app. These third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites. <br>
